# DNNCausal 
The R-package DNNCausal performs estimations of average causal effect and average treatment causal on the treated,
with AIPW by fitting deep neural networks to estimate nuisance models.
A particular use of the package is to use one-dimensional convolutional neural networks for time-series data inputs
(first introduced in Convolutional neural networks for valid and efficient causal inference).
Tensorflow and Keras are used to implement the neural network models.
